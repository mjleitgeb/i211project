## Information Infrastructure II

This is a repository that was used throughout the development of my second project in Information Infrastructure II.

The goal was to create a mock website for a Yoga company in which a user could create, edit, and delete yoga classes. Each yoga class was to include 
- name
- type
- level
- date
- duration
- trainer
- description

The proejct utilizes Flask and Bootstrap for styling purposes and can be accessed at https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~mleitgeb/I211_project.cgi/.
